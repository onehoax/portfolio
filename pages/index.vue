        My name is Carlos Andres Osorio. I was born in Colombia but moved to Toronto, Canada in 2006. I lived in Toronto
        for over 15 years, then moved back to Colombia in 2023, and am currently residing in it. <br />
        I am very passionate about technology in general and how it can be used to improve our lives and help the world.
        I specifically love programming because even though it is very logical, it is also a form of art through its
        infinite layers of abstraction. <br />

      <h1 class="content-heading mt-6">Behavioral Science</h1>
      <p class="mt-4">
        I initially studied Behavioral Science at George Brown, College (TO, CA). This program was tailored to working
        in the autism field, so I worked in the field for a couple of years, designing and implementing behavior
        modification techniques to teach/reinforce functional behaviors and remove problem behaviors. Although I
        eventually decided to transition into software, I am glad to say that I positively impacted the lives of all my
        clients by raising their quality of life through behavior modification. Throughout my time in this field, I also
        had the opportunity to work in places like the University Health Network (UHN) and the Centre for Addiction and
        Mental Health (CAMH), which taught me many valuable life lessons.

      <h1 class="content-heading mt-6">Software Development</h1>
      <p class="mt-4">
        After working in Behavior Modification for a couple of years, I realized that although it was a very rewarding
        field, it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Therefore I decided to go back to University to
        go into Software Development. I completed a Bachelor of Computer Science in 2 years and 1/2 at York University
        (TO, CA). Shortly after graduation, I got into a Data Engineering organization, which then connected me to CIBC
        (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ), where I worked for over 1 year and 1/2 as a Full-Stack Developer. I left
        CIBC as I was moving back to Colombia and have been working independently ever since.
