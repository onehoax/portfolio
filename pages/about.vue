        <span class="font-semibold">KISS </span>(Keep It Simple Stupid) and
        <span class="font-semibold">DRY </span> (Don't Repeat Yourself) are 2 principles that I apply in every aspect of
        my life. I am an avid learner of different technologies and disciplines; I strive to apply my knowledge and
        experience to self-improvement and the betterment of humanity. I love programming because even though it is very
        logical, it is also a form of art through its infinite layers of abstraction. I am from Colombia and am
        currently residing in it, but I lived in Toronto, Canada for over 15 years.

      <h2 class="content-heading mt-6">Software Development</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        After working in Behavior Modification for a couple of years, I realized that although it was a very rewarding
        field, it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Therefore I decided to go back to University to
        go into Software Development. I completed a Bachelor of Computer Science in 2 years and 1/2 at York University
        (TO, CA). Shortly after graduation, I got into a Data Engineering organization, which then connected me to CIBC
        (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ), where I worked for a couple of years as a Full Stack Developer. I left
        CIBC as I was moving back to Colombia and have been working independently ever since. I have worked with various
        technologies throughout my career, but I have mostly used Linux, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript, RDBMSs, and web
        technologies. I am currently submerged in the web world, specifically using PostgreSQL, Prisma, MongoDB,
        TypeScript, Node, Nest, Angular, and Tailwind to design and implement Full Stack PWA solutions following agile
        methodologies.

      <h2 class="content-heading mt-6">Behavioral Science</h2>
      <p class="mt-4">
        I initially studied Behavioral Science at George Brown, College (TO, CA). This program was tailored to working
        in the autism field, so I worked in the field for a couple of years, designing and implementing behavior
        modification techniques to teach/reinforce functional behaviors and remove problem behaviors. Although I
        eventually decided to transition into software, I am glad to say that I positively impacted the lives of all my
        clients by raising their quality of life through behavior modification. Throughout my time in this field, I also
        had the opportunity to work in places like the University Health Network (UHN) and the Centre for Addiction and
        Mental Health (CAMH), which taught me many invaluable life lessons.
