        I design and implement Full-Stack Progressive Web App (PWA) solutions. A PWA is basically a website that can
        behave as a mobile application, as well. This eliminates the need to develop separate systems for the same
        product to target different platforms. E.g.: in the past, a website would usually be accompanied by a
        corresponding Android and iOS app, resulting in a total of 3 separate systems, which accomplish the same
        function, just on different platforms. Because a PWA is developed using web technologies, it is platform
        agnostic; therefore you develop a single product that serves both as the website and as the mobile app.
