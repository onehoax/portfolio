        I design and implement Full-Stack Progressive Web App (PWA) solutions. A PWA is basically a website that can
        behave as a mobile application, as well. This eliminates the need to develop separate systems for the same
        product to target different platforms. E.g.: in the past, a website would usually be accompanied by a
        corresponding Android and iOS app, resulting in a total of 3 separate systems, which accomplish the same
        function, just on different platforms. Because a PWA is developed using web technologies, it is platform
        agnostic; therefore you develop a single product that serves both as the website and as the mobile app.

      <h1 class="content-heading mt-6">Web Sites</h1>
      <p class="mt-4">
        A PWA is suitable for products that are meant to work as applications, meaning they are highly functional and
        usually interact with other services (the underlying OS, a database, market data, etc.). An organization doesn't
        always need a PWA, a simple website to showcase their content might suffice.

        TypeScript/JavaScript can be used for virtually anything since it can be used both on the server and client
        side. I specialize in Full-Stack TypeScript development using Node for the back-end and Vue for the front-end.
